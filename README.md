# Click and Treat üêæ

Click and Treat is a free training tracker to help pet owners structure and document their training sessions! Using Express, Node, and Postgres for the back-end and React and Vite for the front-end, it will allow users to add information about their pets, subscribe to training plans that break down how to teach individual skills, and keep track of each training session they have to teach that particular skill.
